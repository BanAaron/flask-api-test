# flask-api-test
Simple Flask API for testing.

## Setup and Install
First make sure you have Python3 installed, including pip to install dependencies.

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/aarontbarratt/flask-api-test.git`.
2. Navigate to the root directory `cd flask-api-test`.
    1. (Optional) I would highly recommend using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install requirements and not make a mess of your base python install.
3. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run with python `python3 main.py`.
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser of choice.
